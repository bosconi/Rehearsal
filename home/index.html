<h1>What is Puppet?</h1>

<p><a href="https://puppet.com">Puppet</a> is a domain-specific language for
describing system configurations and a client-server runtime system that
implements Puppet configurations (known as manifests) on machines.
To a first approximation, a manifest specifies a collection of resources, their
desired state, and their inter-dependencies. Puppet has several abstractions
that allow you to write clean, modular manifests. In addition, there are
thousands of community-supported modules available on <a
href="https://forge.puppet.com">Puppet Forge</a> that can be easily integrated
into a system configuration.</p>

<h1>What is Rehearsal?</h1>

<p>The Puppet runtime implements some basic checks on manifests, but they
only prevent a small range of errors. Several things can go wrong when
a manifest is actually deployed. <b>Rehearsal</b> is a static verification tool
for Puppet. It uses a model of the file-system state and Puppet's
semantics to verify that manifests don't violate safety properties.</p>

<p>The <a href="../demo">Rehearsal demo</a> on this website verifies that a
manifest is <i>deterministic</i> and <i>idempotent</i>, which are two basic
properties that all manifests should have. It is also straightforward to check custom
post-conditions, if desired. To learn more about Rehearsal, we encourage you to <a

technical paper</a>.</p>
