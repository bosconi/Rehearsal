<h1>Demo</h1>

<p>This online demo lets you apply Rehearal to a Puppet manifest. We've
provided several small manifests below that illustrate the kinds of
bugs that Rehearsal can catch.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The main limitation of Rehearsal is that it does not support manifests with
embedded shell scripts (the <code>exec</code> resource type). Rehearsal supports
several common built-in resource types, but some platform specific types
are not supported. (In particular, resources that depend on Mac OS X and Windows
are not supported.) For more details on its limitations and our future work,
see the <a
